# Task management assignment

### Introduction

- This task management assignment has been created using Vite-ReactJS, state is managed by Redux, styling by TailwindCSS.
- For backend, fastify for nodejs has been used, for data persistance mongodb has been used.
- I chose fastify-mongodb package over mongoose simply because of it's specific compatibility with fastify and how less boilerplate code we have to write with it as compared to mongoose.
  
### To run this project

- clone the GitHub repo.
- open the terminal and type `npm install`
- After the dependencies have been installed run `npm run dev` for frontend and `npm run server` (make sure that you have node installed).
